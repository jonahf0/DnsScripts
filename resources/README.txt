	The files in this directory are to be used for the program's uses. For example, several of the files are 
probably going to be used for bruteforce lookups. One file, the hosts.txt file, comes straight from the fierce.pl perl
script. The other main resource file, websites.txt, contain commonly found and popular websites (for use with cache
snooping).
