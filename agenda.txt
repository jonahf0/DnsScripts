AGENDA


##FIXED##
1) fix bug related to host_discovery_one and two not having same size return arrays

2) fix timeout issues:
	2a) handle timeouts
	2b) return proper timeout error messages, like where the timeout occurs

3) make cache_snoop deduce even if ttl cannot be retrieved

4) implement either:
	4a) resolution of server-address-as-argument to a server name
	4b) main function that does this while implementing all of the functionality,
	so that the other scripts can remain untouched

5) fix error when querying to resolver1.opendns.com:
	cache_snoop on resolver1.opendns.com for azure.microsoft.com gave an IndexError on the return
	statements of get_ttl_from_ns;
	another timeout error was thrown when doing the same thing for office.microsoft.com;
	similar timeout bug occurred when snooping on dns.google for weather.gov
