1) fix bug related to host_discovery_one and two not having same size return arrays
2) fix timeout issues:
	2a) handle timeouts
	2b) return proper timeout error messages, like where the timeout occurs
3) make cache_snoop deduce even if ttl cannot be retrieved
4) implement either:
	4a) resolution of server-address-as-argument to a server name
	4b) main function that does this while implementing all of the functionality,
	so that the other scripts can remain untouched
